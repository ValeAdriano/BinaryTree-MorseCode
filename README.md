# Morse Code Encoder and Decoder Using Binary Tree

This Java project implements a binary tree structure to encode and decode messages in Morse code. The binary tree is constructed based on standard Morse code rules, where:
- `.` (dot) moves to the left child.
- `-` (dash) moves to the right child.

Users can input text to be encoded into Morse code or provide a Morse code sequence to be decoded back into readable text. The program features an interactive menu that allows users to choose between encoding and decoding.

## Features
- **Morse Code Encoding**: Converts plain text (A-Z, 0-9) into Morse code.
- **Morse Code Decoding**: Decodes a Morse code sequence into plain text.
- **Interactive Menu**: Allows the user to choose between encoding and decoding.
- **Binary Tree Structure**: The tree structure efficiently maps Morse code to the corresponding letters or digits.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/morse-code-encoder-decoder.git

2. Compile and run the program:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    java Main
